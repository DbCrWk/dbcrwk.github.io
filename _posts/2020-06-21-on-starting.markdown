My first computer was an old Compaq that my dad built on a languid summer weekend.
The keyboard was a 90's beige with large clacking keys and a distinct set of logos decorating the border.
The monitor was an oversized CRT---heavy, but fragile.

This computer was my start: for my interest in computing, coding, writing, the Internet; all of it.
With my computer, my parents also gave me an email address (hotmail, anyone?).
Eventually, I extended my burgeoning presence on the Internet with my own domain and a crappy, text site to go with it.
I think it might be just old enough to have evaded capture by a web archive.

I next moved to a bold, flashy website built from a template from my hosting provider.
Perhaps it reflected my personality at the time, but this website was chaotic and captured a variety of teen-age thoughts.
At the time, I was also obsessed with tripling punctuation.
So ... everything was written with triple punctuation!!!
Why did I do this???
I don't know.

Eventually, I moved to a hand-written `HTML` website with a bright blue background and the following message:
```txt
Yup, I'm under construction!

¯\_(ツ)_/¯
```
To this day, the "shrug" `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` is one of my most cherished pieces of Internet iconography.
I think I'll keep it around.

Finally, I have arrived here: hopefully, a simple site for some information about me and snippets of my thoughts.
As a kid, I loved reading, especially fantasy/sci-fi novels.
I wasn't a great expository writer, but I enjoyed writing short stories.
As I've gotten a little older, I consume more non-fiction and, correspondingly, have shifted my writing style.

For anyone who knows me in person, it may be surprising to learn that I like communicating my thoughts in writing.
It helps me arrange my thoughts.
For the purposes of this blog, I want to write plainly and to iterate quickly.
When a thought strikes me, I'll write it out (somewhat) coherently and post it.
I'd also enjoy if anyone wanted to discuss any of my ideas or thoughts here, so feel free to reach out to me.
(I even created a twitter.)
